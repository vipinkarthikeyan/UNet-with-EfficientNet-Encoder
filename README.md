# UNet-with-EfficientNet-Encoder
The UNet model used for segmentation takes in different encoders. From in-built and pretrained models on Keras to custom encoders with custom weights, the choices are plenty. In this repository I share my compilation of UNet models with EfficientNetB0 to EfficientNetB7 encoder.
The EfficientNet family of networks (B0, B1, ..., B7), introduced by Mingxing Tan and Quoc V. Le dominated the ImageNet charts achieving higher accuracy with lesser number of parameter through efficient depth, width and resolution scaling.
