# UNet-with-EfficientNet-Encoder
The UNet model used for segmentation takes in different encoders. From in-built and pretrained models on Keras to custom encoders with custom weights, the choices are plenty. In this repository I share my compilation of UNet models with EfficientNetB0 to EfficientNetB7 encoder.
